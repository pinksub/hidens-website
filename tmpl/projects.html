<h4>I have a bunch of projects with varying degrees of quality and activity. Here they are... I guess:</h4>
<p>PubSite - A website that anyone can edit. Yes, <u><em>anyone</em></u>.</p>
<p>RandomApp1 - Some shitpost app I made 2 years ago out of boredom.</p>
<p>HBot - A general purpose Discord bot. Fork of NetRunner, which is a fork of WinBot.</p>
<p>My website - Pretty obvious what this is.</p>
<p>AutOS - A ollection of scripts to automate post-installation for Windows and Arch Linux, at least to my prefrences.</p>
